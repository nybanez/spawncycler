# SpawnCycler
SpawnCycler is a SpawnCycle editor for Killing Floor 2's Controlled Difficulty mod (initially created by Blackout: https://github.com/notblackout/kf2-controlled-difficulty)

The main purpose of this utility is to allow for swift and intuitive creation, generation, analysis, and editing of SpawnCycles for CD.
SpawnCycler attempts to simplify and completely replace the (rather tedious) process of creating a SpawnCycle by hand using a Text Editor.

## Features
- Minimalistic and easily navigable UI
- Simplistic SpawnCycle creation achieved through simplistic "drag-and-drop" operations and other features such as the ability to reorganize the ordering of the waves
- A built-in parser that syntax-checks SpawnCycles, ensuring that created Cycles are fully-compatible with CD
- The ability to Generate a SpawnCycle from scratch based on pre-determined criteria
- The ability to Simulate and Analyze a SpawnCycle based on pre-determined criteria, in order to obtain summary info such as Number of ZEDs Spawned and Difficulty Estimates on a per-wave basis
- The ability to perform Batch operations on a SpawnCycle, such as reversing the wave order or replacing all of one ZED type
