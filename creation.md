## Creating a SpawnCycle

### Overview
When opening SpawnCycler, the initial interface you are presented with is the Creation interface.
This is where you can Create and Edit SpawnCycles.

There are **three** main components to this window:
- WaveDefs Pane (the larger, blank area)
- ZED Pane (the pane off to the right with the ZED icons)
- Messages Box (the bottom-most box)

The **WaveDefs Pane** is where most of the action takes place.
This is where you will add **Waves** and create and manage **Squads**.

The **ZED Pane** contains all of the ZEDs needed to create a SpawnCycle.
A mode toggle can be found at the top of this area, which allows the user to switch back and forth between the **Custom** and **Default** ZED sets.
- The **Custom** ZED set includes additional ZEDs (such as E.D.A.Rs) and is primarily designed to be used with **Forrest Mark X's** build of CD, however some other builds of CD may support these custom ZEDs as well.
- The **Default** ZED set is the primary ZED set supported by the main branch(es) of CD.

Finally, the **Messages Box** contains any System Messages outputted by the program.
Errors and general notifications will appear here.


### Adding Waves, ZEDs, and Squads
When opening SpawnCycler for the first time, you'll be presented with a blank window with an "Add Wave" button.
Pressing this button adds a new wave to the SpawnCycle.
